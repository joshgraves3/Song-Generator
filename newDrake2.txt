I know youve been hurt by someone else
I can tell by the way you carry yourself
If you let me heres what Ill do
Ill take care of you
Ive loved and Ive lost
Ive asked about you and they told me things
But my mind didnt change
And I still feel the same
Whats a life with no fun please dont be so ashamed
Ive had mine youve had yours we both know
We know they dont get you like I will
My only wish is I die real
Cause that truth hurts and those lies heal
And you cant sleep thinking that he lies still
So you cry still tears all in the pillow case
Big girls all get a little tasteah
Pushing me away so I give her spaceah
Dealing with a heart that I didnt break
Ill be there for you I will care for you
I keep thinking you just dont know
Trying to run from that say youre done with that
On your face girl it just dont show
When youre ready just say youre ready
When all the baggage just aint as heavy
And the partys over just dont forget me
Well change the pace and well just go slow
You wont ever have to worry
You wont ever have to hide
Youve seen all my mistakes
So look me in my eyes
Cause if you let me heres what Ill do
Ill take care of you
Ive loved and Ive lost
Yeah
Its my birthday Ill get high if I want to
Cant deny that I want you but Ill lie if I have to
Cause you dont say you love me
To your friends when they ask you
Even though we both know that you do you do
One time been in love one time
You and all your girls in the club one time
All so convinced that youre following your heart
Cause your mind dont control what it does sometimes
We all have our nights though dont be so ashamed
Ive had mine youve had yours we both know
We know you hate being alone
You aint the only one
You hate the fact that you bought the dream
And they sold you one
You love your friends but somebody shoulda told you somethin to save you
Instead they say
Dont tell me I dont care
If you hurt I dont tell you
You dont care if youre true
Dont tell me I dont care
If you hurt I dont tell you
You dont care if youre true
I know youve been hurt by someone else
I can tell by the way you carry yourself
If you let me heres what Ill do
Ill take care of you
Ive loved and Ive lost
How Im feeling it doesnt matter
Cause you know Im okay
Instead I ask myself why do you worry
When you know you know Im the same
You know I know you dont love me baby
Theyre trying to take you away from me
Only over my dead body
I think I killed everybody in the game last year man
Fuck it I was on though
And I thought I found the girl of my dreams at a strip club
Mmm mmm fuck it I was wrong though
Shout out to all my niggas living tax free
Now-a-days its six figures when they tax me
Oh well guess you lose some and win some
Long as the outcome is income
You know I want it all and then some
Shout out to Asian girls let the lights dim some
Shots came I dont know where they was sent from
Probably some bad hoes about to take the hint from
Yeah you know me well nigga
Yeah I mean you aint the only real nigga
They got me on these white women like Seal nigga
Slave to the pussy but Im just playing the field nigga
Yeah are these people really discussing my career again
Asking if Ill be going platinum in a year again
Dont I got the shit the world wanna hear again
Dont Michael Jordan still got his hoop earing in
Man all of your flows bore me paint drying
And I dont ever be trippin off of what aint mine
And I be hearing the shit you say through the grapevine
But jealousy is just love and hate at the same time
Yeah its been that way from the beginning
I just been playing I aint even notice I was winning
And this is the only sound you should fear
Man these kids wear crowns over here and everything is alright
I know I know that you love me baby
Theyre trying to take you away from me
Only over my dead body
You say Im old news well who the new star
Cause if Im going anywhere its probably too far
Just performed at a Bar Mitzvah over in the states
Used half of the money to beat my brothers case
Red wine over Fed time
And shout out to the niggas thats doing deadtime
Shout out to the bitches there when its bedtime
And fuck you to the niggas that think its their time
Yeah dont make me take your life apart boy
You and whoever the fuck gave you your start boy
Or you wanna be a muthafuckin funny guy
Dont make me break your Kevin Hart boy
Yeah its whatever You know feeling good living better
I think maybe I was numb to it last year
But you know I feel it now more than ever
My city love me like Mac Dre in the Bay
Second album Im back paving the way
The backpackers are back on the bandwagon
Like this was my comeback season back back in the day
And I met your baby moms last night
We took a picture together  I hope she frames it
And I was drinking at the Palms last night
And ended up losing everything that I came with
Yeah feel like Ive been here before huh
I still got 10 years to go huh
And this is the only sound you should fear
Man these kids wear crowns over here
And everything is all right
I can see it in your eyes youre angry
Regret got shit on what youre feeling now
Mad cause he aint like me
Oh you mad cause nobody ever did it like me
All the care I would take
All the love that we made
Now youre trying to find somebody to replace what I gave to you
Its a shame you didnt keep it Alicia Katia
I know that you gon hear this Im the man

Dont you forget it
The way you walk  thats me

OK look Im honest
Girl I cant lie I miss you
You and the music were the only things that I commit to
I never cheated for the record back when I was with you
But you believed in everything but me girl I dont get you
She says I know you changed I never see you
Cause youre always busy doing things
I really wish she had a different way of viewing things
I think the city that were from just kinda ruined things
Its such a small place not much to do but talk and listen
The men are jealous and the women all in competition
And now your friends telling you stories that you often misinterpret
And taint all the images of your Mr Perfect
I could tell that you been crying all night drinking all summer
Praying for your happiness hope that you recover uh
This is one I know you hated when you heard it
And its worse because you know that I deserve it
May your neighbours respect you
Trouble neglect you
Angels protect you
And heaven accept you
I might be too strung out on compliments
Overdosed on confidence
Started not to give a fuck and stopped fearing the consequence
Drinking every night because we drink to my accomplishments
Faded way too long Im floating in and out of consciousness
And they sayin Im back Id agree with that
I just take my time with all this shit I still believe in that
I had someone tell me I fell off ooh I needed that
And they wanna see me pick back up well whered I leave it at
I know I exaggerated things now I got it like that
Tuck my napkin in my shirt cause Im just mobbin like that
You know good and well that you dont want a problem like that
You gone make someone around me catch a body like that
No dont do it aye please dont do it aye cause one of us goes in
And we all go through it aye

Listen to you expressing all them feelings
Soap opera rappers all these niggas sound like all my children
And thats who you thinking is bout to come and make a killing
I guess it really is just me myself and all my millions
You know that they aint even got it like that

Smoking weed under star projectors
I guess well never know what Harvard gets us
But seeing my family have it all
Took the place of that desire for diplomas on the wall
And really I think I like who Im becoming
Theres times where I might do it just to do it
Like its nothing
Theres times when I might blow like 50k on a vacation
For all my soldiers just to see the looks on all they faces
All it took was patience
I got a lot of friends to come up off the strip for me
The same ones thatll come up off the hip for me
The realest niggas say your lyrics do shit for me
I told my story it made his story
Tell em Imma need reservations for 20
Ive never really been one for the preservation of money
Nah I much rather spend it all while Im breathing
That OVO and that XO is everything you believe in I know

Rappin bitches rappin bitches bitches
And rappin rappin and bitches until all of it switches
I swear its been two years since somebody ask me who I was
Im the greatest man I said that before I knew I was
Thats whats important and what really happened before this
When me and my crew was all about this rapper from New Orleans
Singing walking like a man finger on the trigger
I got money in my pocket Im a uptown nigga ah
With fame on my mind my girl on my nerves
I was pushing myself to get something that I deserve
That was back in the days Acura days
I was a cold dude Im getting back to my ways
People always ask how I got my nice things
Take my crown to the grave Im an underground king
I bet we can make tonight the greatest story ever told
Cause Im down to spend whatever lately Ive been on a roll
And I do it for the city cause you know the city love it
Nigga do it for the city cause you know the city love it
Nigga do it for the city cause you know the city love it
Nigga do it for the city UGK fuck these other niggas
Sometimes I need that romance sometimes I need that pole dance
Sometimes I need that stripper thats gon tell me that she dont dance
Tell me lies make it sound good make it sound good
Do me like the women from my town would
Leather with that woodgrain Persian rugs on wood floors
Talking all them good things thats all Im really good for
Memphis Tennessee no see I start to go deep back
And Ridgecrest with my seat back with Yo Gotti and E-Mack
And these niggas got them diamonds glowing in they mouth
And they rockin furs like its snowing in the south
And every pretty girl tell me thats the shit that she like
So why am I in class if this is who Im trying to be like
So I drop out lessons I was taught are quick to fade
Soon as I realized that turning papers in wont get me paid
And if I dont nothing Ima ball
Im countin all day like a clock on the wall
Yeah I need that making major changes to the life Im living
I had no choice I had to prove I made the right decision
That was back in the days Acura days
I was a cold dude Im getting back to my ways
People always ask how I got my nice things
Take my crown to the grave Im an underground king
I bet we can make tonight the greatest story ever told
Cause Im down to spend whatever lately Ive been on a roll
And I do it for the city cause you know the city love it
Nigga do it for the city cause you know the city love it
Nigga do it for the city cause you know the city love it
Nigga do it for the city UGK fuck these other niggas
Yeah never thoughts of suicide Im too alive

Even though dying isnt in the plans
But neither was making it and here I am
In the presidential do you like your new room
Always presidential and tonights no blue moon
Since I saw Aaliyahs precious life go too soon
She deserve the credit for how Im about to get it
Thats why I got a new dumb thing moving through the street
Got a new condo move it to the beach
Heard Nicki just bought a brand new crib
Goddamn man shes beauty and the beast Lord
Seems like yesterday that I was up and coming
Still so young that I aint had enough of nothing
The fam here the drink here the girls here

And you deserve some fucking credit how did anyone forget it
Got a show up in your city yo girl is in the line
And the line around the corner its my motherfucking time
You should take it as a sign man I got it right now
I wouldnt doubt it cause these bitches all about it right now
Lets be real about this shit can I take you home
Or come to where you stay Do you live on your own
I heard you got your ways I never would have known
She said youre such a dog I said youre such a bone
Ive been everywhere where you know me from
These days women give it to me like they owe me one
But they crave attention though they always saying Show me something
But girl you aint the only one thats trying to be the only one
At least I admit that if you get that and you with that
Then fuck lets get it then

Should we make this one a double
You aint even gotta ask ah

You understand me
Playing with these motherfucking millions like they aint nothing
Rubber band stacks That YMCMB shit nigga Flashy lifestyle

All we wanted was opportunity
Just Blaze Lord Knows
Its your worst nightmare its my first night here
And this girl right here who knows what she knows
So Im going through her phone if she go to the bathroom
And her purse right there I dont trust these hoes at all
But thats just the result of me paying attention
To all these women that think like men with the same intentions
Talking strippers and models that try to gain attention
Even a couple pornstars that Im ashamed to mention
But Weezy and Stunna are my only role models
Heffer and Jordan are my only role models
Thats why I walk around with all this gold on
And every time I run into these niggas they want no problems
Buy them sixes and chains and some bracelets and rings
All of the little accents that make me a king
I never hear the disses they try and point out to me
But its whatever if somebody wan make it a thing
Im more concerned what niggas thinkin about Christmas in August
Do anything to buy gifts for they daughters
Get some shake a brick in the press
And chef it like Mrs Fields theyre making the cookie stretch
I know it so well I know the hustle so well
Stunt like Im workin overnighters right by the motel
Drug money outfit record clean
Spend it all on me and my fuckin team
Matchin Rollies for real matchin Rovers for real
Places they say theyve been weve actually going for real
Im really killin shit fuck all the jiggy rappin
Im going trigga happy just to see my niggas happy
Mixtape legend underground kings
Lookin for the right way to do the wrong things
With my new bitch thats living in Palm Springs
Young ass nigga lifelong dreams
They take the greats from the past and compare us
I wonder if theyd ever survive in this era
In a time where its recreation
To pull all your skeletons out the closet like Halloween decorations
I know of all the things that I hear they be pokin fun at
Never the flow though they know I run that
Fuck you all I claim that whenever
I change rap forever the game back together yup
YM I remain that forever
In the same place my brother Wayne that forever
Im a descendent of either Marley or Hendrix
I havent figured it out cause my story is far from finished
Im hearing all of the jokes I know that they tryna push me
I know that showin emotion dont ever mean Im a pussy
Know that I dont make music for niggas who dont get pussy
So those are the ones I count on to diss me or overlook me
Lord knows Lord knows Im heavy I got my weight up
Roll this and boost your rate up its time that somebody paid up
A lot of niggas came up off of a style that I made up
But if all I hear is me then who should I be afraid of
Bought a white Ghost now shit is gettin spooky
Very very scary like shit you see in the movies
In this bitch all drinks on the house like Snoopy
Thats why all the real soldiers salute me
Trill nigga for real
You know I love this
YOLO You Only Live Once
Im going so hard my nigga I swear homie
Everyday is another opportunity to reach that goal
I fell in love with the pen started fucking in ink
The hustles an art I paint it what I would think
Still allergic to broke prescription straight to the paper
Destined for greatness but got a place in Jamaica
Villa on the water with the wonderful views
Only fat nigga in the sauna with Jews
Went and got a yacht Im talkin Carnival cruise
And these niggas talkin like hoes they mad they not in my shoes
Its the red bottom boss came to buy the bar
Every by week shit Im bound to buy a car
Murder-cedes Benz of that bubble double R
Headlights flickin lookin like a fallin star
Everyday them hammers bang whippin yay like Anna Mae
I run the game but the ladies think Im running game
Mink coats making women wanna fornicate
Rosay and Drake Im gettin cake nothin short of great
Word on road its the clique about to blow

All my exes live in Texas like Im George Strait
Or they go to Georgia State where-
Tuition is handled by some random nigga that live in Atlanta
That she only see when she feels obligated
Admitted it to me the first time we dated
But she was no angel and we never waited
I took her for sushi she wanted to fuck
So we took it to go told them dont even plate it
And we never talked too much after I blew up
Just only hello or happy belated
And I think I text her and told her I made it
And thats when she text me and told me she prayed it
And thats when I text her and told her I love it
Then right after text her and I told her Im faded
She asked
What have I learned since getting richer
I learned working with the negatives can make for better pictures
I learned Hennessy and enemies is one hell of a mixture
Even though its fucked up girl Im still fucking wit ya
Damn is it the fall
Time for me to revisit the past
Its women to call
Theres albums to drop theres liquor involved
Theres stories to tell we been through it all

Hold my breath til my face turn purple
Keep a few bad bitches in my circle
My nuts hang like aint no curfew
Bitch if you wave then I will surf you
I flew jet she flew commercial
But we still met later that night
After my session she came over
I was aggressive and she was sober
I gave her a pill
She started confessing and started undressing
And ask me to hold her
And so I did but that was last month
And now shes texting me asking for closure
Damn
She say this shit gon catch up to me
I keep tissue paper
We eat each other whenever we at the dinner table
She say she hate that she love me
And she wish I was average
Shit sometimes I wish the same
And I wish she wasnt married
Promises I hope I never break em
Met a female dragon had a fire conversation but
Interviews are like confessions
Get the fuck up out my bedroom confusing me with questions like
